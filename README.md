# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.

This is my first changes to the readme.md. file. Firstly, I created a new branch 
using the master node. Now, I have created a new branch named 'readme-edits'.

Earlier changes were done from the master branch.

Now, I have selected the 'readme-edits' branch and the changes made should come in 'readme-edits'
After that, I will compare the changes made using pull request.
